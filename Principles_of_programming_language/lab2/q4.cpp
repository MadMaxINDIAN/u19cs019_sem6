// An educational institution wishes to maintain a database of its employees. 
// The database is divided into a number of classes whose hierarchical relationships are shown in the following figure. 
// The figure also shows the minimum information required for each class. 
// Specify all classes and define functions to create the database and retrieve individual information as and when required. 
// The database created does not include educational information of the staff. 
// It has been decided to add this information to teachers and officers (and not for typists) which will help management in decision making with regard to training, promotions etc. 
// Add another data class called education that holds two pieces of educational information namely highest qualification in general education and highest professional qualification. 
// This class should be inherited by the class's teacher and officer.
